		<h2>Hip Hop</h2>
			<h3>Origin of the term</h3>
			<p>
				The creation of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy, 
				rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. However,
				Lovebug Starski, Keith Cowboy, and DJ Hollywood used the term when
				the music was still known as disco rap. It is believed that 
				Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined 
				the U.S. Army, by scat singing the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way 
				that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy 
				later worked the "hip hop" cadence into a part of his stage performance
				, which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in 
				"Rapper's Delight".Universal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa 
				is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in
				which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was
				a derogatory term to describe the type of music. The first 
				use of the term in print was in The Village Voice, by Steven
				Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.
			</p>
			<h4></h4>
			<p>
				Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music,
				is a music genre developed in the United States 
				by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s 
				which consists of a stylized rhythmic music 
				that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic 
				and rhyming speech that is chanted.
			</p>
			<p>
				It developed as part of hip hop culture,
				a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements:
				MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables,
				break dancing, and graffiti writing. 
			</p>
			<p>			
				Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines
				from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), 
				and rhythmic beatboxing.
			</p>
			<h3>1970s</h3>
			<p>
				Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was 
				formed during the 1970s when block parties became
				increasingly popular in New York City, particularly
				among African-American youth residing in the Bronx. 
				However hip-hop music did not get officially recorded
				for the radio or television to play until 1979,
				largely due to poverty during hip-hop's birth 
				and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods.
			</p>
			<h4>How did DJ's Mix at Block Parties?</h4>
			<p>
				DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using 
				two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks 
				from two copies of the same record, alternating from one
				to the other and extending the "break".
				Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology
				and drum machines became widely available and affordable.
				Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching
				developed along with the breaks and Jamaican toasting,
				a chanting vocal style, was used over the beats. 
				Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist
				speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental
				or synthesized beat.
			</p>
			<h3>New school hip hop</h3>
			<p>
				New school hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, 
				originating in 1983â€“84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C.
				and LL Cool J. The Golden age hip hop period was an 
				innovative period between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s.
				Notable artists from this era include the Juice Crew, 
				Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions and KRS-One,
				EPMD, Slick Rick, Beastie Boys, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, 
				Ultramagnetic MCs, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest.
				Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that often focuses 
				on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city
				African-American youth. Schoolly D, N.W.A, Ice-T, Ice Cube,
				and the Geto Boys are key founding artists, known for mixing 
				the political and social commentary of political rap with the 
				criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap.
				In the West Coast hip hop style, G-funk dominated mainstream 
				hip hop for several years during the 1990s with artists such 
				as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. East Coast hip hop in the early to 
				mid 1990s was dominated by the Afrocentric jazz rap and
				alternative hip hop of the Native Tongues posse as well as 
				the hardcore rap of artists such as Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang Clan,
				and Onyx. East Coast hip hop also had gangsta rap musicians
				such as the Notorious B.I.G. and Lil' Kim.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 1990s, hip hop began to diversify with other regional 
				styles emerging, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop. 
				At the same time, hip hop continued to be assimilated into other 
				genres of popular music, examples being neo soul (e.g.: Lauryn Hill,
				Erykah Badu) and nu metal (e.g.: Korn, Limp Bizkit). Hip hop became
				a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the top selling music
				genre by 1999. The popularity of hip hop music continued through 
				the 2000s, with hip hop influences also increasingly finding their
				way into mainstream pop. The United States also saw the success 
				of regional styles such as crunk (e.g.: Lil Jon & the East Side
				Boys, the Ying Yang Twins), a Southern genre that emphasized the
				beats and music more than the lyrics. Starting in 2005, sales of
				hip hop music in the United States began to severely wane. 
				During the mid-2000s, alternative hip hop secured a place in 
				the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists
				such as OutKast and Kanye West.[20] During the late 2000s and 
				early 2010s, rappers such as Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, and B.o.B 
				were the most popular rappers. During the 2010s, rappers such 
				as Drake, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole, and Kendrick Lamar all have been
				extremely popular. Trap, a subgenre of hip hop, also has been
				popular during the 2010s with hip hop artists and hip hop music 
				groups such as Migos, Travis Scott, and Kodak Black.
